                            Mobile robots operating outdoors must maintain stability under terrain uncertainty and slip. This project develops a whole-body reinforcement learning policy for a wheeled quadruped that coordinates wheel and leg dynamics to improve stability across varying terrain conditions.

                            I built simulation environments in Isaac Sim and MuJoCo and trained a PPO policy with reward shaping focused on speed, stability, and slip reduction. The work emphasized understanding sim-to-real transfer challenges such as friction mismatch and wheel–ground interaction.

                            The policy achieved stable locomotion in simulation but degraded in real-world trials due to unmodeled friction losses and terrain irregularities. A systematic failure analysis identified simulation fidelity limits and informed future friction-aware modeling strategies.
